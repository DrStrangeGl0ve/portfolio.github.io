# IMPORTANT: You will need to add a config.py file to this root folder with the following line:
# API_KEY = "key"
# Replace "key" with your actual API key(as a string) from the Riot Games Developer Portal.
# Include the config.py file in your .gitignore to avoid exposing your API key.
# Remember that if you're on a Development API Key, you'll need to change this every 24 hours.
